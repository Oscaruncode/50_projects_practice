# 50projectspractice
This is a repository for practice js, html and css, by trying to mock the things planted on bradtraversy/50projecs50days repository.

Methodology
1) Select one project.
2) View the live demo.
3) try to mock only with the only view in the first visit of the project.
4) If the previus step is not enough, i inspect with developer tools F12.
5)  If the previus step is not enough, i search in google about related things.
6)  At finish, if all goes wrong, i inspect the code in the repository and try to do my self version.
